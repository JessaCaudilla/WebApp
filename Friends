<p>Thanks to God,he let me to became a La verdarian.In La Verdad I met Gielyn,Xyleeh,Jasmin,Jennelyn,and ate Melay 
who always in my side in times of loneliness.They made me laugh and enjoy college life.They are always their 
to give comfort and advice in times of pain.They accept of being who I am and understand my dark side.
They motivate me to continue my course  when I want to give up.Sometimes,I feel guilty for I have done the things that made 
them hurts.When they reading this essay I want to tell them "I'm sorry.".
I am blessed to have you guys!.I;m thankful to God because he gave me a precious gift that can't exchange by material things in life.</p>
